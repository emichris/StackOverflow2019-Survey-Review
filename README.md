## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow's 2019 survey data to better understand the relevance of having higher education degrees (post High School) in software engineering careers by looking at the following: 

1. Are people with High School diploma as satisfied in their software engineering job/career as those with higher educational degrees?
2. Are people with high school degrees paid at same rate as people with college education?
3. How do they feel about becoming managers (growth opportunity)?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook `stackreview-data-analysis.ipynb` available [here](https://github.com/emichris/StackOverflow2019-Survey-Review/blob/master/stackreview-data-analysis.ipynb) are used to explore the data in order to answer the business questions.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for each individual step.   

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found in this article on medium [Is there opportunity for people with only High School diploma in Software Engineering?](https://medium.com/@christian.emiyah/is-there-opportunity-for-people-with-only-high-school-diploma-in-software-engineering-e3224bcdceed).
